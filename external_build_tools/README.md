# Using ROS2 with external build tools

If you want to include ROS2 functionalities into a non-ROS2 project, the build process could become not trivial.

Here you find examples for building an hello-ros executable using standard building tools (i.e. **CMake** and **SCons**) instead of the native ros one (**Colcon**).


Additional examples can be found in this ROS1 repository ([link](https://github.com/gerkey/ros1_external_use)).
